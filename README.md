### 💡 Featured Projects:

This project in the `src/development` directory is a comprehensive showcase of my skills in test automation, API development, containerization, and infrastructure as code.

- **Development | WebAPI:** A .NET Core Web API (`AccountAPI in /.webapi`) for user account management powered by LiteDb datastore.
- **Test Automation:** Robust collection of test suites (NUnit | xUnit | NSubstitute | Containerization | Azure | Terraform)
  - **_Unit_** (in `./.webapi.tests.unit`) demonstrating unit tests which isolate a single unit of code and mock all of its direct dependencies.
  - **_T1_** (in `./.webapi.tests.t1`) demonstrating in-memory integration tests, exercising different parts of the WebAPI in a controlled environment.
  - **_T2_** (in `./.webapi.tests.t2`) demonstrating virtualized integration tests via Docker.
  - **_T3_** (in `./.webapi.tests.t3`) demonstrating virtualized performance tests via Docker.
  - **_T4_** (in `./.webapi.tests.t4`) demonstrating production tests (Backlog feature).
- **Containerization:** Docker integration for the `AccountAPI` in `./.docker`, enabling consistent deployment.
- **CI/CD:** Azure Pipelines configuration (`azure-pipelines.yml`) for automated builds, tests, and Docker image pushes, including SonarQube analysis.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Related Terraform configurations (in `./terraform`) demonstrate provisioning Azure VMs for hosting the WebAPI.

### 🔨 Skills & Technologies

### 🛠️ Open Source Contributions



### 🌱 Learning & Development

I am committed to staying at the forefront of DevOps and cloud-native technologies.

- **Currently Mastering:** AI | Full suite understand and implementaiton of large language models (LLMs)
- **Exploring:** DevOps architecture, deployment pipelines, and cloud infrastructure
- **Future Goals:** Azure AI-900, AWS Certified AI Practitioner and very-likely IBM AI Engineering Professional (coursera)
- **Making it simple:** Think of AI as the parent technology, and LLMs as a specialized subset within it, excelling at natural language processing
